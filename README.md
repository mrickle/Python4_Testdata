# PyCitySchools Challenge Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the average scores for reading and math for the local high schools except for the Thomas High School 9th graders. It was also to determine the average score per school size and based on budgets to help with future distracting and where the money should be spent.
## Results
*Most district's reading and match scores and overall scores stayed the same from the orinigal data as only a small portion of student grades, 9th graders from Thomas High, were removed.
* the school summary was updated because the scores for Thomas High were elevated by removing the 9th grade scores
*replacing those scores brings Thomas High into the top 5 of averages whereas they were in the bottom tier before.
Replacing 9th grade scores
* Math and Reading rose by about 30 percentage points
* Scores by school spending stayed the same
## Summary
The four major changes that occurred is the number of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores, and the overall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School. Removing the total number of students from a school would raise the average due to a smaller amount to be divided into. the removal of those students would increase the average scores but would have no effect on budgets for that school.
